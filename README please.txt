I chose Ruby.. Been workin on that for a bit now.
Here is a working solution with a bunch of enhancements.
I have life_spec.rb to run the rspec tests on the class

Ways to Run the Program: (Assuming you have Ruby (1.9.3 +) and gems: RSpec [for unit test] and Yard [for documentation])
- to run the program with three examples : run 'ruby  life.rb'
- to run unit (spec) testing of the Game : run 'rspec  life_spec.rb'

PS: If you don't have ruby on your machine, I have the documentations and all the outputs here to let you know what the code does..

To access the Documentation, either run 'publish_doc.bat' if you have ruby and the 'yard' gem
Else just open './Life_doc/_index.html'

Enjoy!
